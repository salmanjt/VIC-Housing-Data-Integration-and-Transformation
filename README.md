# Victorian Housing Data Integration and Transformation for Predictive Analysis

![VIC-housing-data-pipeline](images/VIC-housing-data-pipeline.png)

## Project Description

This project focuses on integrating and transforming diverse datasets related to housing in Victoria, Australia. The primary objective is to create a unified dataset by merging data from multiple sources such as XML, JSON, shapefiles, GTFS data, PDFs and web-scraped information. This unified dataset facilitates comprehensive data analysis, trend identification and machine learning applications in the real estate domain.

## Key Steps Involved

### Data Loading

Importing data from XML and JSON property files, shapefiles for suburb boundaries, GTFS public transport data, PDFs for LGA-to-suburb mappings, and web-scraped housing data.

### Data Integration

-   **Property Data:** Merging XML and JSON property information into a single DataFrame, ensuring consistency and handling duplicates.
-   **Geospatial Mapping:** Mapping properties to suburbs and LGAs using geographic coordinates through spatial joins.
-   **Transport Accessibility:** Calculating distances to nearest train stations and estimating travel times to Melbourne Central using GTFS data.
-   **Web Scraping:** Extracting additional housing data, such as median house prices, number of houses/units and demographics from `house.speakingsame.com`.

### Data Transformation

-   **Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing values, correcting data types and standardising formats across the integrated dataset.
-   **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables such as travel time to Melbourne Central (`travel_min_to_MC`) and direct journey flags (`direct_journey_flag`).
-   **Normalization and Scaling:** Applying data transformation techniques such as z-score standardisation, min-max scaling, and log transformations to prepare the dataset for modeling.

### Model Evaluation

Assessing the impact of different data transformation techniques on linear regression models, using performance metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

Overall, this project highlights a robust approach to turning heterogeneous and unstructured data into a cohesive dataset suitable for downstream analysis, providing a strong foundation for real estate market analysis and urban planning efforts.

## Technologies Used

-   Python (Pandas, NumPy)
-   Geospatial Analysis (GeoPandas, Shapely, Folium)
-   Data Visualisation (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
-   Web Scraping (Requests, BeautifulSoup)
-   PDF Processing (PDFMiner)
